# Mask-Detector_CNN
White Mask Detector with a Convolutional Neural Network 

Inspirational Code found on: https://pub.towardsai.net/covid-19-face-mask-detection-using-deep-learning-and-opencv-9e554c380e23

Used for a TU Berlin Rasperry PI Master Project - WS 2020/21

Next Steps:
- expand Data Set for different mask colors, light and position conditions 
- train model again - Testing for the accuracy that works out best for real life apllication
